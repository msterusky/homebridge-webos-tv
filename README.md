# homebridge-webos-tv

`homebridge-webos-tv` is a plugin for HomeBridge which allows you to control your webOS TV! It should work with all TVs that support webOS2 and newer.
The idea is that the TV should be controlled completely from the native HomeKit iOS app and Siri, that is why volume appears as a light bulb or external input as a switch.

### Features
* HomeKit TV integration
* Power status
* Turn on / off
* Mute Status (as light bulb)
* Mute / Unmute (as light bulb)
* Volume control (as light bulb and switches)
* Open apps (switch between apps of your choice and live tv)
* Channel control
* Media control
* Show notifications
* Emulate remote control

## Installation

      "accessory": "webostv",
      "name": "My webOS tv",
      "ip": "192.168.0.40",
      "mac": "ab:cd:ef:fe:dc:ba",
      "keyFile": "/home/pi/.homebridge/lgtvKeyFile",
      "pollingInterval": 10,
      "tvService": true,
      "inputs": [
          {
            "appId": "com.webos.app.livetv",
            "name": "Live TV"
          },
          {
            "appId": "com.webos.app.hdmi1",
            "name": "PS4"
          },
          {
            "appId": "youtube.leanback.v4",
            "name": "YouTube"
          },
          {
            "appId": "com.webos.app.photovideo",
            "name": "Photo Video"
          }
      ],
      "volumeControl": false,
      "channelControl": false,
      "mediaControl": false
    }
  ]  
}
```

You also need to enable **mobile TV on** on your TV for the turn on feature to work correctly.

This is located on your TV under `Settings > General > Mobile TV On`

On newer TVs **LG Connect Apps** under the network settings needs to be enabled.

## Troubleshooting
If you have any issues with the plugin or TV services then you can run homebridge in debug mode, which will provide some additional information. This might be useful for debugging issues. 

Homebridge debug mode:
```sh
homebridge -D
```
